# (Note: Use the existing select field)
# And I click "Search For Members"

# Then I should see the total number of people who live in the Fire Nation. (should be close to 100)
# And I should see a list with the detailed information for the first 25 members of the Fire Nation.

# - The name of the member (and their photo, if they have one)
# - The list of allies or "None"
# - The list of enemies or "None"
# - Any affiliations that the member has
